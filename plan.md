## 12/28/22

+ Project repository created.
+ README.md, plan.md, and .gitignore (for Python) files created.
+ Brainstorming of project begins. It was decided that a program accessed through a website, likely using the Flask micro web framework[^1], would be the most appropriate way to approach the prompt.
+ A few website names were considered, including: "Activitea" where each event ("activitea") fills up your teacup with more points; "Highlight" where the website is colorful to promote the idea that school events are fun and the "highlight" of your education; and "TrackPack" where you track events to fill up your 'trackpack', similar to a school backpack, which promotes an eduational theme.
